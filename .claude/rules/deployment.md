# Deployment rules

Branch strategy, Railway/Vercel specifics, and the PR testing matrix.
Full platform setup (env vars, one-time configuration, GitHub branch
protection) lives in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Branch strategy

**Flow:** `feature/* → staging → main`. Always branch from `staging`,
never from `main`.

| Branch | Role | Deploys to |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production | mehamakor.co.il + Railway prod env |
| `staging` | Pre-production testing | staging.mehamakor.online + Railway staging env |
| `feature/*` | New work | Vercel preview URL only |

- **Never push directly to `main` or `staging`.** Both are PR-only.
- **Hotfixes** (the only direct-to-main exception) must be back-merged to
  `staging` immediately so the lines don't drift.
- **Auto-deploy on merge to `main` or `staging`** is wired and verified
  end-to-end. Vercel ships the frontend via its native GitHub
  integration; [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  runs `railway redeploy` via the Railway CLI against the matching
  environment in the `believable-tenderness` Railway project so the
  backend can't lag behind. Two env-scoped tokens
  (`RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_STAGING_TOKEN`); environment is
  selected via the `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` env var, **not** the
  `--environment` flag (the current CLI rejects it).

  "Branch Strategy" + "One-Time Platform Setup".

## Railway runtime port

**Railway runtime port = 8080**, not 8000. Railway injects `$PORT=8080`;
Dockerfile binds uvicorn to `${PORT:-8000}`. Railway → service →
**Settings → Networking → Target Port** must be `8080`.

Mismatch → `502` with `X-Railway-Fallback: true` on every request despite
a healthy container. The `EXPOSE 8000` line in the Dockerfile is
documentation-only — do not copy it into Railway's port settings.

Full trap + debugging context:
[docs/LOCKED_DECISIONS.md](../../docs/LOCKED_DECISIONS.md) →
"Railway runtime port = 8080".

## PR approval flow

After every PR — send the Vercel preview URL:

```
בדיקי על: https://food-mamkor-[hash].vercel.app
```

**Wait for approval before merging to staging.** Full mobile checklist:
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) → "Testing workflow".

| PR type | What to check | Testing needed? |
|---|---|---|
| docs-only (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, CLAUDE.md) | Read the diff | None |
| infra-only (.github, settings.json, .gitignore) | Read the diff | None |
| UI change | Test Vercel preview on mobile | Yes |
| Backend change | Test the affected API endpoint | Yes |
| Hotfix | Test only the broken thing | Minimal |
