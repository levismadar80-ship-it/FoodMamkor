# RTL rules

Hebrew is RTL. Every positional class, every map layer, every password
input has to be thought through — physical left/right don't mean what
they look like on an RTL page.

---

## Logical properties — never use physical directional classes

Use logical properties:

- `start-*` / `end-*` instead of `left-*` / `right-*`
- `ms-*` / `me-*` instead of `ml-*` / `mr-*`
- `ps-*` / `pe-*` instead of `pl-*` / `pr-*`

When adding ANY positional class, ask: **is this directional?** If yes,
use the logical equivalent.

### Which physical side does each resolve to? (RTL)

The whole site is `dir="rtl"` (set at the layout root), so logical
properties flip relative to a default LTR page:

- `start-*` → **right** · `end-*` → **left**
- `ms-*` → margin-right · `me-*` → margin-left
- `ps-*` → padding-right · `pe-*` → padding-left

So **"primary action on the RIGHT in RTL" = `start-*`, NOT `end-*`.** The
common slip is reading `end-` as "the end = the right side" — in RTL the
*end* is the **left**. When unsure, picture the text flow: it **starts on
the right** and **ends on the left**.

_Source: 2026-06-25 /map UX batch — an orchestrator instruction specified
`end-` for a right-aligned control; CC caught that `end-` resolves to the
left in RTL and corrected it to `start-`. (meta-patterns.md §1 — verify
orchestrator claims.)_

### Intentional physical-property exceptions (keep as-is, add `// rtl-ok` comment)

- Eye-toggle buttons inside `dir="ltr"` password inputs (`right-3`)
- Carousel prev/next arrows
- `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` horizontal-center idiom
- `pr-11 pl-4` password-input padding pair
- Map geographic controls (zoom, locate)

Each exception exists because the surrounding element is `dir="ltr"` or
the property is logically symmetric (horizontal center). Outside these
cases, always use logical properties.

## Map z-index tokens (do not use arbitrary values on `/map`)

```
tiles:0 → markers:400 → tooltips:500 → bottom-sheet:600 →
legend:800 → controls/zoom/search:1000 → BottomNav pill:1000 →
cookie banner:1100 → chat FAB:9999
```

Code is the source of truth; this ledger mirrors it — update the table
when a component's z-index changes (grep'd MEH-861: `BottomNav.jsx:152`
`z-[1000]`, `CookieBanner.jsx:68` `z-[1100]`, `ChatWidget.jsx:174`
`zIndex: 9999`).

Bottom sheets must ALWAYS sit below map controls. See `globals.css` for
CSS overrides and `MapClient.jsx` for the Tailwind classes that reference
these tokens.

## Known RTL bug patterns (cross-ref [docs/BUG_PATTERNS.md](../../docs/BUG_PATTERNS.md))

- **RTL eye toggle** — password inputs use `dir="ltr"`; toggle must be
  `right-3` (physical), never `left-3`. Live in `/login` + `/register`.
- **Leaflet tooltip z-index** — must be `500` (between markers:400 and
  bottom-sheet:600). See Map z-index tokens above.

---

## RTL allowlist — single source of truth (MEH-365 / MEH-426)

`.claude/hooks/rtl-allowlist.txt` is the **single source of truth** for RTL
exceptions. Both enforcement tools read from it:

- `check-rtl.sh` (PreToolUse hook) — blocks edits to non-allowlisted files
  containing physical RTL classes unless every violation is annotated within
  ±1 line of an inline marker.
- `verify-frontend` agent — static scan reports violations not covered by
  a path exception or an inline marker (±1 adjacency).

### Two sections in the allowlist

```
# ============ PATH EXCEPTIONS ============
# Files where physical properties are justified (entire file exempt).
frontend/app/map/MapClient.jsx
...

# ============ CONTENT PATTERNS ============
# Inline annotation markers (suppress individual violations within ±1 line).
rtl-ok
```

Both consumers parse the file with the same awk state-machine (look for
`# === PATH EXCEPTIONS` / `# === CONTENT PATTERNS` headers, skip comments
and blank lines, route entries by section). No blank lines anywhere — `grep
-v -f` treats them as match-everything patterns.

### Inline `rtl-ok` annotation

Add `rtl-ok` on the same line as a physical class, or either adjacent line
(±1), to suppress a single violation without exempting the whole file:

```jsx
{/* rtl-ok */}
<div className="left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2">   {/* horizontal center — direction-neutral */}
```

Both tools enforce the same ±1 window. A new physical exception that is
not direction-neutral → add the file to PATH EXCEPTIONS instead of using
inline annotation.
